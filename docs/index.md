# Compression of Voxel Models

This is the documentation of my research project at TU Dresden.

This documentation was written using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
You can browse this offline by hosting it as a static web page on a local server.

To name an example, use `python3 -m http.server 8000` in the root directory to host this page locally on port 8000.
