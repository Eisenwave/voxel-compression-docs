    You can browse this offline by hosting it as a static web page on a local server.
    Many functions such as searching or syntax highlighting won't work when opening this project with a `file://`
    scheme.

    To name an example, use `python3 -m http.server 8000` in the root directory to host this page locally on port 8000.
